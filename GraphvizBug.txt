To display our access graphs we use Graphviz and its utility dot. We discovered and reported a bug (http://www.graphviz.org/mantisbt/view.php?id=2427) that causes the program to crash during the dot to png conversion.

By manually removing some arcs from the puck generated dot file, the conversion is possible. For the concerned code, you will find an altered dot file that you can use to visualize the corresponding graph. We removed the arcs by commenting them so you can check which one we remove and compare the dot file provided with the one generated by our tool puck.

Concerned graphs :

bridge/huston/refactored
decorator/shrinked/intermediate
decorator/shrinked/refactored
state/intermediate
visitor/pattern

The dot file can be converted to a png using the following command:
dot -Tpng dot_file > png_file
